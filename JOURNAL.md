03/06/2023 - I have spent most of today trying to remove the unnecessary portions of doggr, but for some reason I can't shake the calls to the match.ts or message.ts files. Also typeorm really likes referencing them as well.
03/08/2023 - I started today with making a plan and schedule for how I should proceed with this project. Two weeks is not a lot of time, but I hope to accomplish as much as I can in that timeframe.
             I created the game model and am working on seeding. After running pnpm seed, I've encountered the erorr "Error seeding databaseQueryFailedError: update or delete on table "profile" violates foreign key constraint "FK_80e61381b28b6b6dd958c13be6d" on table "match"" which is particularly frustrating because I don't really care about those anyways. I am going to stash my changes to see if that was the impact. Seems like the issue was I didn't do typeorm:drop somewhere, or perhaps I needed an extra typeorm:updateDatasource. We have successfully added a game model for high scores into our database.
03/18/2023 - My goal today is to get the leaderboard components running. Perhaps have a basic leaderboard page. Update: I have done the interface api interface portions of the leaderboard such as get, post, and delete requests. 
             Progress is incredibly slow but I am proud I got something done. The most difficult part for me is usually getting started as I tend to get anxious and pocrastinate. I'm optimistic for tomorrow. I plan on getting a leaderboard page going and start on user authentication. Then, tackle file storage and make a simple game.
